# Portfolio_ML
Machine Learning Portfolio

## Portfolio Setup (Overview of Machine Learning)
Summarized the main branches of ML algorithms and reflected on my personal interest in ML.

You can see the [document here](Machine_Learning_Overview/Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## C++ Data Exploration
Statistical functionalities in C++.

You can see the [document here](C++_Data_Exploration/Data_Exploration.docx) and the [code here](C++_Data_Exploration/data_exploration.cpp)

## Linear Models
Perform data cleaning and data exploration on medium-sized data sets, perform machine learning using linear models, and evaluate model performance.

You can see the [Regression document here](Linear_Models/Regression.pdf) and the [Regression code here](Linear_Models/Regression.Rmd)

You can see the [Classification document here](Linear_Models/Classification.pdf) and the [Classification code here](Linear_Models/Classification.Rmd)

## ML Algorithms from Scratch
Gain deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms by coding from scratch.

You can see the [Logistic Regression code here](ML_Algorithms_scratch/logisticRegression.cpp) and the [Naive Bayes code here](ML_Algorithms_scratch/naiveBayes.cpp).

You can see the [report here](ML_Algorithms_scratch/ML_Algorithms_from_scratch.docx).

## Searching for Similarity (Group Project)
Gain experience with machine learning using similarity models kNN and Decision Trees, clustering methods kMeans and hierarchical clustering, and  dimensionality reduction techniques LDA and PCA.

You can see the [repo/code here](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/ml-similarties/tree/main).

You can see the [Regression document here](Searching_for_Similarity/Regression.pdf), [Classification document here](Searching_for_Similarity/Classification.pdf), [Clustering document here](Searching_for_Similarity/Clustering.pdf), and [Dimensionality document here](Searching_for_Similarity/Dimensionality.pdf).

## Kernel and Ensemble Methods
Gain experience with machine learning using SVM linear, polynomial, radial kernels, and ensemble techniques.

You can see the [Regression document here](Kernel_Ensemble_Methods/Regression.pdf) and the [Classification document here](Kernel_Ensemble_Methods/Classification.pdf).

You can see the [narrative report here](Kernel_Ensemble_Methods/Kernel_and_Ensemble_Metthods.docx).

## ML with sklearn
Gain experience with machine learning in sklearn on a small data set.

You can see the [pdf here](ML_with_sklearn/ML_with_sklearn.pdf).
