# Portfolio_ML
Machine Learning Portfolio

## Portfolio Setup (Overview of Machine Learning)
Summarized the main branches of ML algorithms and reflected on my personal interest in ML.

You can see the [document here](Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## C++ Data Exploration
Statistical functionalities in C++.

You can see the [document here](Data_Exploration.docx) and the [code here](data_exploration.cpp)

## Linear models
Perform data cleaning and data exploration on medium-sized data sets, perform machine learning using linear models, and evaluate model performance.

You can see the [Regression document here](Linear_Models/Regression.pdf) and the [Regression code here](Regression.Rmd)

You can see the [Classification document here](Linear_Models/Classification.pdf) and the [Classification code here](Classification.Rmd)

## ML Algorithms from Scratch
Gain deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms by coding from scratch.

You can see the [Logistic Regression code here](logisticRegression.cpp) and the [Naive Bayes code here](naiveBayes.cpp).

You can see the [report here](ML_Algorithms_from_scratch.docx).

## Searching for Similarity (Group Project)

You can see the [repo/code here](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/ml-similarties/tree/main).
